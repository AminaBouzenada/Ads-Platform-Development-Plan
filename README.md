# Ads-Platform-Development-Plan
# ðŸ“Œ Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step plan to complete the Ads Platform with **Supabase** (backend/auth), **Chargily Pay** (payments), and **Vercel/Netlify** (deployment).  

---

## Week 1 â€“ Backend + Core Features

### **Day 1 â€“ Setup & Cleanup**
- Configure `.env` with Supabase + Chargily sandbox API keys.  
- Verify Supabase project is online.  
- Clean project structure (remove mock data after testing).  

### **Day 2 â€“ Authentication**
- Implement Supabase auth (login/register).  
- Add user roles:  
  - **Admin** â†’ dashboard, campaign approvals, user management  
  - **Advertiser** â†’ create campaigns, make payments  
  - **Viewer** â†’ limited dashboard access  

### **Day 3 â€“ Route Protection**
- Protect pages with role-based access control.  
- Redirect unauthorized users (e.g., Advertiser trying to access `AdminDashboard`).  

### **Day 4 â€“ Database Schema**
Create Supabase tables:  
- **users** â†’ id, email, role, profile info  
- **campaigns** â†’ id, advertiserId, name, objective, audience, budget, creative, status  
- **payments** â†’ id, campaignId, userId, amount, status (pending/paid/failed), transactionRef  

### **Day 5 â€“ Campaign Builder Integration**
- Connect **CampaignBuilder** steps to DB.  
- When advertiser completes all steps, insert into `campaigns` with status = `Draft`.  

### **Day 6 â€“ Admin Management**
- Admin can view **Pending campaigns**.  
- Admin can approve/reject campaigns.  
- Campaign lifecycle: `Draft â†’ Pending Payment â†’ Pending Approval â†’ Accepted/Rejected â†’ Running/Ended`.  

### **Day 7 â€“ CRUD Operations & Testing**
- Advertiser: **Edit/Delete campaigns** before approval.  
- Admin: **Manage users (suspend/delete)**.  
- Replace all mock data with live Supabase queries.  
- Test full flow (**create â†’ approve â†’ cancel**).
